# Landing Page Project

This project is implementing the basic skills of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build a beautiful interactive website.

## Approach

* I started by mimicing almost the same elements from the original HTML file provided by Udacity with few modifications to match the desired result.
* Then creating a CSS file from scratch following the original CSS file's order but with an added touch to give a different feeling to the looks of the page.
* Last thing. I created the js file and added the options needed to give the page the desired interactivity. This had to bring some slight edits to the HTML and CSS files to match the new elements and their effects.

## Github repository

I've tried updating my github repository after my daily sessions of working on the project so that you might follow some changes history.
